# GMTK-2023-Project
 
My idea for  GMTK Game Jam 2023

The theme was: **Roles Reversed**

## The Idea
My idea was based on the famous truck-kun present in the anime (and the like) media.
When the protagonist is sent to the another world, they usualy die in the real world by being run over by a truck.

Therefore, in my game, you play as the truck and while trying to finding most suitable people to send to an another world.

Different worlds send their prefrences about what kind of people they want.
If you choose (by running over) a perosn who meets most/all of the criteria, you get more points.
They opposite it also true if the perosn dosen`t meet most/all of the criteria.
